  <li>Seed seeking does not fully work for 8.6+ yet. If it can't find the seed, roll another cat, and put your new last 10 cats. When you don't have any duplicated rare cats in the last 10 rolls, it can find the seed.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    Now we can filter buff and control separately. For buff, it can
    never have more than one, so it does not have the option for all.

<ul>
  <li>
    Renamed Metal ability to Metalic. This is done to avoid ambiguity with
    metal trait.
  </li>
  <li>Filtering cats now support filtering abilities, too.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2025-04-26") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug where using owning or dropping all cats can have some
    weirdness if some of the cats are already owned. The bug was introduced
    for preparing to add filtering option.
  </li>
  <li>
    Show the regular options before the owning cats options. This looks more
    consistent comparing to other pages.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a cats specialization filter.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2025-04-21") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a new seeker backend from VampireFlower, which is much faster than
    the current one. With some small samplings (n &lt; 5), it's 25x to 200x
    times faster! This should much reduce the server load and the size of
    queue. Also note that some seeds cannot be found by the current one
    can also be found by this new one.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2025-04-20") %>
<ul>

    <p>
      Remember the last rolled cat even when switching to a banner which
      doesn't have the cat. Essentially the blank option in the drop down
      menu will preserve whatever it is before, without showing what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also means that you can no longer drop the last cat by using the
      blank option, and you have to edit the URL to drop it if you need.
      This can be annoying when once you're able to retreat the seed, which
      means the last rolled cat no longer makes sense. When we have this
      feature, retreating the seed should likely drop the last cat.

    <ul>
      <li>5B -&gt; 8B was wrong. It should be 5B -&gt; 7B, therefore guaranteed for 3A "AAA Wunder" is wrong.</li>
      <li>In <a href="/?seed=1732891581&event=2019-07-21_391&pick=1BGX#N1B">track A</a> now it's 4A -&gt; 6A, which is correct, therefore guaranteed for 1B "Eva Unit-01" is correct for the same slot.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2020-04-26") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added first legendary or uber cat's name and last uber cat's name to the
    customized gacha name. For example, if you see Splendid Ganesha as the
    last uber's name, it's likely that it's a platinum gacha. If it's
    uberfest or epicfest, then it's likely with Radiant Aphrodite. If the
    first name is a legendary uber, then it's likely that regular gacha.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the customized gacha contains a cat which is not available in the game,
    for example, there are a few exclusive BCJP cats which don't exist in
    BCEN, but their corresponding gacha are still in the game, those would
    show with a question mark and will not show any tracks at all.
    Previously, the site will crash if that's the case. So this is a bug fix.

    Owned cats encoding revised. Previously, it was a list of cat ids,
    compressed and base64 encoded. It turned out that it was super long.
    Now we just use a bit mask using bit fields to indicate the cat ids,
    and use radix 62 to encode the integer. This turned out to be pretty
    concise that turning 912 characters into 89 characters, about 10 times
    better.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also changed the query name from <code>owned</code> to just
    <code>o</code>. I would prefer spelling it out but we need a different
    name to distinguish them.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also redirect to the canonical URL while picking cats.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reverse the list of cats, putting the latest on the top so it's easier to
    tick new cats.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2020-04-13") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    We now redirect you to the canonical URL if you're not at it.
    Note that every time you change something in the control panel
    (e.g. switching the event), you'll move to non-canonical URL.
    It wasn't a big concern when we didn't have so many options, but
    since we're having more and more options, it's adding up. This
    effort is trying to keep the URL short.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ideally it should not redirect you, but just stick with the
    cleanest canonical URL when you touch the control panel, but
    I just hate writing JavaScript so simply redirecting from the
    server is so much easier to implement, and it seems fast enough
    anyway.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a bug where last rare cat wasn't considered as a potential dupe
    while highlighting. This was a long standing bug which has nothing to
    do with the URL cleanup.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2020-04-04") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a way to customize an event with any gacha id and probabilities.

<%= header(2, "2020-03-22") %>

    Fixed an edge case where guaranteed cats might be missing for some cells.
    It was happening when one of the cells had a dupe from both A and B, and
    when that happened next cat data would be lost causing missing guaranteed.
    It was only discovered with Merc Storia because it has the most dupes.

<ul>
  <li>Highlight the middle 5 rolls differently for step-up events. This may help you plan out when we have multiple step-up events happening at the same time.</li>

  <li>Added cat db links in the cat list in detailed mode.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-12-31") %>
<ul>
  <li>Added a new feature so that you can pick which cats you owned from the <a href="<%= route.cats_uri %>">cats list</a>.</li>
  <li>When you pick the cats, it'll save the list in URL with <code>owned</code> query string, which can be very long if you have a lot of cats.</li>
  <li>Cats which you owned will be low-lighted with <span class="owned">azure color</span>, making it less obvious even if it's an uber cat.</li>

  <li>Now we use R to indicate a rerolled cat. For example, 11AR is the cat at 11A rerolled into. 11ARG is the cat at 11A guaranteed, but starting from the rerolled position.</li>
  <li>Highlighting system is greatly improved. Now it can properly highlight if you would be picking the rerolled cat or not.</li>
  <li>In the new highlighting system, you can click on the upper part of a cell, which will automatically find which cats you'll be rolling into, from the past to the future. Your cursor will show a "help" icon in this case.</li>
  <li>Or you can click on the lower part of a cell, just beside the cat's name. In this case, the system will specifically show how it'll work if you're rolling into that specific cat. Your cursor will show a "plus" icon.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Guaranteed columns should be fully working for 8.6+ now. You don't have to set force guaranteed to 2 and count manually anymore.</li>

  <li>Highlighting the rolling path is done for 8.6+. Try clicking on the cells.</li>
  <li>The super duper edge case for duplicated collaborate rare cats has been fixed. Everything should be predicted correctly now.</li>

    The bug had two consequences:

      <li>It might give the wrong re-rolled cat upon duplicated collaborate rare cat.</li>
      <li>It might give you the wrong destination, not just wrong cat.</li>

  <li>You can check seed <a href="/?seed=1815690119&event=2019-07-18_391">1815690119</a> to observe this. On 6A, the re-rolled cat should move you to 8A, rather than 7B. On 10A, now it's giving you a Tin cat rather than Mari cat, but move you to the same destination.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>The default version is now switched to 8.6+ (experimental). It's still marked as experimental because guaranteed columns are not properly done yet.</li>
    <li>The workaround is that now we allow you to simulate the guaranteed ubers with just 2 rolls. This means the guaranteed uber showed in 10A will be the same as the old guaranteed uber showed in 1A, assuming that you didn't have any duplicated rare cats sitting in the middle, switching your tracks. This will be accurate if you know what you're doing.</li>
    <li>Consult with an expert on this if you don't understand.</li>
    <li>Highlighting is not done for 8.6+ yet.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-06-05") %>
<ul>
  <li>More updates for the experimental 8.6+ support. Keep in mind it might not be always correct!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Now you'll know which re-rolled cat you'll get.</li>
    <li>A lot of edge cases are properly handled now.</li>
    <li>Highlighting and guaranteed uber is still working in progress.</li>
    <li>Seed seeking will not be worked on before we're sure the tracking is correct.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-06-02") %>
<ul>
  <li>Added experimental 8.6+ support. Keep in mind it might not be always correct!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When the same rare cat was rolled in a row, the game will not just give you a fixed rare cat now, it'll instead move the seed at least once (we don't know if it's always just once yet) to roll another rare cat for you, therefore it'll <strong>switch your track!</strong></li>
    <li>We don't know how the newly re-rolled rare cat is determined for now, nor do we know if this will affect another re-roll when the next cat happens to be the same as the re-rolled cat again.</li>
    <li>The page will now try to remember the last cat you rolled, making sure 1A can be determined correctly. 1B is ignored in this case.</li>
    <li>Highlighting is disabled for 8.6+ for now, because it might not be accurate due to switching upon duplicated rare.</li>
    <li>Guaranteed roll is disabled for 8.6+ as well, again because it might not be accurate due to switching upon duplicated rare in the middle.</li>
    <li>You can still get the same super rare cat in a row. The same is assumed for ubers and legendary cats. Only rare cats have this re-rolling effect.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The page will now remember what's your last rolled cat. This will be used for the experimental 8.6+ support, but it has no use prior to 8.6.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-05-27") %>
<ul>
  <li>Updated version option so that 8.5 is just 8.5. It doesn't work for 8.6</li>
  <li>Show the slot code as the prefix for seed seeking.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-04-25") %>
<ul>
  <li>Added an option to select the version. Both 8.4 and 8.5 should work.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-03-03") %>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug crashing help page if details is checked.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-02-12") %>
<ul>
  <li>Add a third link in the seeking result if 10 cats were filled.</li>
  <li>Help messages for seeking the seed is updated accordingly.</li>

<%= header(2, "2019-02-06") %>
<ul>
  <li>Update event data for 8.2 for BCEN and BCTW.</li>
  <li>Add support for BCKR.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-01-30") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cache for TSV files raised from 300 seconds to 600 seconds.
    Use curl or JSON if you can't wait for it to expire.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-01-26") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    I won't update this page merely for event data update any more.
    Not worth the troubles.
  </li>
  <li>Now we serve event data links in this page.</li>
  <li>
    Remove 世界一即戦力になるにゃんこ達！ which lasts to 2030 for BCJP because
    that's for older version (8.1-) and we have another properly scheduled
    event for it, too.
  </li>
  <li>More margin-bottom for ul, remove hr.</li>
  <li>Now we preserve as much as arguments on query string.</li>
  <li>Merge simulation for guaranteed into the same row with find cats.</li>
  <li>Remove unuseful home page link in the bottom.</li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2019-01-11") %>
<ul>
  <li>Update BCEN and BCTW event data</li>
  <li>Update data source link to GitLab</li>

<%= header(2, "2018-12-29") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use cell cursor for the table cell so it's more clear
    they are clickable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a new feature that we can click on the table cell and it'll highlight
    the rolled cats.
    <span class="picked">Stands for regularly rolled</span> cats, and
    <span class="picked_consecutively">stands for consecutively (11 or 15)
    rolled</span> cats. <span class="next_position">Indicates the next
    position</span> after the rolls. Highlights are not preserved for now
    because it's not very easy to implement based on the current approach.
    Maybe we can do that later if needed.
  </li>
  <li>Fix a bug that "Exclude guaranteed" wasn't preserved.</li>
  <li>
    Add white background to guaranteed column if there is a cat.
    This should make it more visually consistent.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2018-12-28") %>
<ul>
  <li>Add change log page with cat job icon</li>
  <li>Add titles to help page and seek page</li>
  <li>
    Slightly enlarge the sniper cat icon to make it more visually balanced
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2018-12-27") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Move the server under control of systemd from screen.
    This should greatly increase the stability of the site,
    because systemd will restart the server once it crashed.
    Previously, I have to restart it manually.
  </li>
</ul>

<%= header(2, "2018-12-26") %>
<ul>
  <li>
    Views are now rendered by tilt and it should improve the performance a bit
  </li>
  <li>
    Now views are also cached once the server started.
    This avoids crashing when the code is updated yet the server
    is not restarted yet. The server may not be restarted immediately if
    someone is trying to find the seed. So this should improve stability.
  </li>
  <li>Some smaller bugs and text are fixed/updated</li>
</ul>
